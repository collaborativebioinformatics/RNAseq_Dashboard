*Visualize genome-wide RNA-Seq data*


The Genome-Wide RNA-Seq Viewer is a web application that enables users to visualize genome-wide expression data from data in count format.

This repository contains a data pipeline written in Python.  It extracts aligned RNA-Seq data from count format and transforms it into a format used by [Ideogram.js](https://github.com/eweitz/ideogram), a JavaScript library for chromosome visualization.  The minimal front-end allows users to see the distribution of genes across the entire human genome.

# How to
Broadly, the pipeline does the following:

1. Get data in count format
2. Count reads for each gene and normalize expression values to [TPM units](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22872506)
3. Get coordinates and type for each gene from [a GFF file](http://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/Homo_sapiens/ARCHIVE/ANNOTATION_RELEASE.105/GFF/ref_GRCh37.p13_top_level.gff3.gz) in the [NCBI Homo sapiens Annotation Release](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/annotation_euk/Homo_sapiens/105/)
4. Format coordinates and TPM values for each gene into JSON used by Ideogram.js

## Transform DGE matrix
Each differential gene expression (DGE) matrix needs to be transformed to Ideogram JSON.

The dge_to_ideogram.py CLI module converts a DGE matrix file containing gene expression summary statistics into an Ideogram.js annotations JSON file. The resulting JSON file is used for exploratory data analysis as demonstrated at:

https://eweitz.github.io/ideogram/differential-expression



## DGE matrix format
The DGE matrix has several groups of columns, with headers ordered like so:

* metadata: `“REFSEQ”,”SYMBOL”,”GENENAME”,”ENSEMBL”,”ENTREZID”,”STRING_id”,”GOSLIM_IDS”`

* replicates: `<sample_prefix>-<group>-<replicate_number>, e.g. “Mmus-C57-6T-TMS-FLT-Rep1”`

 * stats: `“All.mean”,”All.stdev”,”F.p.value”`

* stats_by_group: `Group.<stat>_(<group>), e.g. “Group.Mean_(Space Flight)”`

* stats_by_comparison: `<stat>_(<group1>)v(<group2>), e.g. “Log2fc_(Ground Control)v(Space Flight)”`

Example DGE matrix
An example DGE matrix is [GLDS-21_array_differential_expression.csv](https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/static/media/dataset/GLDS-21_array_differential_expression.csv?version=1) from [GLDS-21](https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-21/), produced by NASA GeneLab. Below is an excerpt.
